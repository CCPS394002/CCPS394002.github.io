    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working toward my personal life by setting up my own bakery. My professional life I would like to be a baker because I enjoy baking things in unusual ways. Experiences that led me here was that I saw my mom cooking and I thought that I wanted to bake so I baked cookies.
I am working toward this goal by baking more often and making new recipes. I have a goal where I would like to create my own recipe.
Values that I consider are most necessary for my success is responsibility, hardworking, not lazy, and fun. I would like to create a bakery that is not so serious but when it needs to get serious it does, and we can have fun making desserts as well.
Short term goals I hope to achieve are going for scholarships and going to college to get a degree in baking. Another short-term goal I would hope to do is to keep getting good grades throughout my high school years.
Character traits and achievements I want to be known for are being a diligent worker, kind, even funny, but a leader, a leader when it comes to working and most definitely a leader when it comes to planning. Achievements I want to be known for being in JROTC and helping 
other people and even volunteering for people or to help them in ways they need help in.</p>
